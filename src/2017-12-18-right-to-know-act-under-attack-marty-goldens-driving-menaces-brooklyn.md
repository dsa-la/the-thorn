## In-Depth: Right to Know Act

The [Right to Know Act](http://changethenypd.org/about-right-know-act-legislation) was first introduced in 2014, as a part of a larger legislative response to stop-and-frisk policies that had been widespread in the NYPD under the Bloomberg administration. As the NYPD's abusive tactics became more commonly understood, many organizations and members of the City Council touted the Right to Know Act as a common sense measure to rein in abuses.

The "Right to Know" legislation is a package of two bills: Intro 182, "Requiring NYPD officers to identify themselves during certain interactions with the public," and Intro 541, "Protecting New Yorkers against unconstitutional searches."

However, the latest iteration of Intro 182 (Intro 182-D, the fourth version since it was originally introduced) has caused a schism amongst Council Members and a breach of trust between police reform advocates and their apparent allies in the Council. For years, Mayor de Blasio has vowed to veto the bill, and with the help of Speaker Mark-Viverito, the bill never made it to the floor for a vote. However, Council Member Ritchie Torres, the sponsor of Intro 182, appears to have [negotiated](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/city-council-compromises-nypd-search-reform-bills-article-1.3693789) a backroom deal with Mayor de Blasio and the NYPD to write a compromise bill that significantly reduces the type of officer interactions that would require police to identify themselves under the new law. Torres is generally known as a relatively progressive member of the Council, but this about-face may be linked to his attempt to build broader support behind his candidacy for Speaker.

Prominent [advocacy](http://changethenypd.org/releases/communities-united-police-reform-releases-statement-right-know-act-bills)  [groups](https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/backroom-deal-threatens-weaken-real-police-reform-new-york-city) who have been working on the Right to Know Act over the years have cried foul as a result of the changes to Intro 182. Two Brooklyn Council Members, Jumaane Williams and Brad Lander, have also expressed their opposition to this half of the Act. In a joint [statement](http://myemail.constantcontact.com/WILLIAMS-LANDER-STATEMENT-OPPOSING-CURRENT--RIGHT-TO-KNOW--BILL-0182-D.html?soid=1102557709761&aid=7U3ACfqYz9w) released on December 14:

"The current bill being considered is markedly different and would be significantly less effective than the legislation we first introduced half a decade ago. Essential elements [in Intro 182] have been watered down and stripped out, including the majority of police-civilian stops, as well as traffic stops. Removing these provisions strikes at the heart of what the original Right to Know Act aimed to accomplish."

Intro 182-D, as before, proposes that police officers provide a business card for identification and explain their investigatory purpose and reason. However, new [loopholes in the bill](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/12/12/police-reform-group-accuses-torres-of-surrender-on-right-to-know-143683) state that providing identification isn't required for non-emergency situations and traffic stops --- essentially negating the very bill itself. This significantly strips citizen's rights and clouds transparency, especially in vulnerable communities. The mysterious death of [Yang Song](https://injusticetoday.com/family-former-attorney-of-queens-woman-who-fell-to-her-death-in-vice-sting-say-she-was-sexually-d67461a12f1) serves as an example of the dangers posed by the lack of transparency in policing. The Flushing immigrant fell to her death on November 25 while the NYPD was attempting to arrest her for alleged sex work, but her family alleges that she had multiple abusive encounters with officers in the weeks leading up to her death.\
Both bills in the Right To Know Act will reach the Council floor for a vote on Tuesday, December 19. On Tuesday morning at 11AM, NYC-DSA is [joining](https://www.facebook.com/events/172598263344003/) a broad coalition of community groups outside of City Hall to demonstrate against this backroom deal that undermines the initial vision of the Right to Know Act. Advocates are urging citizens to call and fax their Council Members to vote yes on Intro 541 (which is still intact and in line with its original intention) and no on Intro 182.

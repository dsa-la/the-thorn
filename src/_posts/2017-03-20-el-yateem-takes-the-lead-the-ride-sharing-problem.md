## In-Depth: The People v. Uber and Lyft

Less than three months in, 2017 has already proven to be a tough year for the Public Relations department at ridesharing company Uber. [Over 200,000 people](http://www.businessinsider.com/over-200000-people-deleted-uber-after-deleteuber-2017-2) actually #deletedUber in protest after Uber crossed the picket line during the JFK airport strike. Numerous[ female](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber) employees have [spoken out](https://medium.com/@contactkeala/sexism-at-uber-from-female-management-uberstory-238874075bbb#.v4jevbj0x) recently about the sexism they experienced at work. CEO Travis Kalanick was [pressured into stepping down](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-trump-advisory-council.html?_r=0) from an advisory council to President Trump. He then had to [apologize](http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21717810-many-woes-ubers-boss-travis-kalanicks-uber-apology) after being [caught on tape yelling at an Uber driver](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/in-video-uber-ceo-argues-with-driver-over-falling-fares) (and dancing to Maroon 5). Reports are now being spread of many drivers across the country who are [sleeping in their cars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-23/when-their-shifts-end-uber-drivers-set-up-camp-in-parking-lots-across-the-u-s).

[Uber is notorious for its poor treatment of workers](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/apploitation-city-instaserfs). Legally, drivers are treated as though they are small businesses (independent contractors) and thus Uber is off the hook for health insurance, vehicular expenses/gas, and guaranteeing their workers minimum wage. The City Council of Seattle is fighting back -- [unanimously passing a law](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/unions-for-taxi-uber-drivers-seattle-council-votes-today/) allowing rideshare workers to unionize. Of course, [Uber is doing everything](http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/03/17/25028459/uber-loses-legal-challenge-but-seattle-unionization-law-still-at-risk) they [can to make sure that doesn't happen](https://www.uber.com/drive/seattle/collective-bargaining/) including [serving anti-union podcasts](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/14/14912524/uber-driver-app-podcast-seattle-union) directly to drivers in its app as a part of a year-long [propaganda campaign](https://qz.com/927777/the-teamsters-have-finally-begun-to-organize-uber-drivers-in-seattle/).

Seattle wouldn't be the first time Uber has used misinformation as a weapon in its battle against local governments. In 2016, Uber and Lyft joined forces, spending [over 8 million dollars](http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2016-04-30/money-doesnt-talk-it-swears/) to [convince voters](http://jalopnik.com/ride-hailing-companies-spent-8-million-to-make-everyon-1774409502) in Austin, Texas that their City Council aimed to ban ridesharing entirely. In reality, Austin was simply proposing mild safety precautions. [It remains a popular misconception that Austin kicked out Uber.](https://medium.com/@callawaythings/misconceptions-about-uber-lyft-and-austin-5a6725e9d5f3)

Lyft has been seeing an increase in popularity due to Uber's recent image problems ([thanks in part to some from prominent virtue signaling](http://gizmodo.com/as-deleteuber-trends-lyft-pledges-1-million-to-aclu-1791750060)) but it is only marginally better. Taxis are often valorized, but [the medallion system is problematic in its own right](https://priceonomics.com/post/47636506327/the-tyranny-of-the-taxi-medallions). Companies like Juno in NYC or RideAustin (a non-profit that quickly filled the vacuum when Uber and Lyft left Austin) are genuine improvements for workers but don't address the inherent costs to the public at large of ridesharing - especially when compared to public transportation.

**Why this matters:** Despite public perception that ridesharing is a net positive for a city's transportation infrastructure, a [recent study](http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/02/27/its-settled-uber-is-making-nyc-gridlock-worse/) shows that issues regarding traffic such as gridlock are exacerbated in NYC by ridesharing companies. While the overall population of NYC rises, use of subways and buses are going down. The MTA is already cash-strapped from the lingering effects of Superstorm Sandy. Ridesharing companies undermine support of public transportation by artificially keeping prices low and wages high (thanks to a surplus in venture capital funds) until the [infrastructure is dependant upon them](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2016/12/cities_are_cutting_transportation_service_because_they_think_uber_will_fill.html) - then [drastically lowering wages](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/01/uber-cuts-prices-and-kneecaps-drivers.html) and using enormous sums of money to wage wars against local governments that try to fight back. Investing in a robust public transportation infrastructure that works for all citizens (as opposed to allowing gaps to be filled by private ridesharing companies) is an objectively more efficient use of resources from an economic, environmental and ethical perspective.

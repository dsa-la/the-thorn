## Local News
-   The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) admitted at a City Council hearing that [over 300,000](https://www.wsj.com/articles/anger-as-new-york-city-public-housing-residents-go-without-heat-hot-water-1517961207) of their public housing residents (80 percent of their units) have been [without heat](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/02/06/sparked-by-heat-outages-nychas-widespread-problems-laid-bare-at-contentious-hearing-241127) this season. NYCHA blames the loss of over $3 billion of federal aid. NYCHA Chair Shola Olatoye once again [testified](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/embattled-nycha-chairwoman-testifies-heating-systems-failure-article-1.3803137) before the City Council about the heating failures, after misleading Council Members in December about inspections that had been performed. In a rare move, she was accompanied by City attorney Zachary Carter for this most recent testimony.
-   Mayor De Blasio and Police Commissioner James O'Neill, have pushed back against Manhattan DA's Cyrus Vance [stated policy](https://www.amny.com/news/turnstile-jumping-de-blasio-1.16587067) of not prosecuting people for jumping subway turnstiles. MTA Chairman Joe Lhota also opposed Vance's move. Meanwhile, court watchers say that Vance's office has not been adhering to the reformist policies he has [publicly announced](https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/02/08/vances-das-wont-stop-throwing-the-book-at-petty-crime/).
-   Politico reports that over the past six years, pervasive gender discrimination and [sexual harassment in Albany](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/02/07/sexual-harassment-in-albany-6-years-a-thousand-complaints-and-more-than-64-million-237144) has generated over one thousand complaints and $6.4M in legal settlements. Politico's analysis follows news earlier in the week that a major NYC-area charter school lobbying group is [shutting down](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/02/05/families-for-excellent-schools-planning-to-close-following-ceos-firing-235707) after its CEO was fired for sexually harassing employees.
-   Evidence introduced at Joseph Percoco's federal corruption trial shows that Governor Cuomo was [often present](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/percoco-cuomo-corruption.html) while Percoco was improperly using his office. Percoco, who is accused of taking bribes from developers and a power company, was Cuomo's campaign manager, so his presence in the Governor's office violated campaign laws.
-   While being deposed for a lawsuit over the City's affordable housing lottery policy, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen called Council Members ["not that smart"](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/02/06/de-blasio-official-calls-council-members-not-that-smart-in-affordable-housing-depostion-238506) and accused them of lacking basic understanding of housing issues. Glen, a former Goldman Sachs executive and frequent target of housing advocates, later apologized.
-   The Village Voice reports that, despite Governor Cuomo last month publicly blocking the a Department of Corrections policy that would prevent prisoners from receiving books, similar policies are already in place in [at least nine](https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/02/07/despite-cuomo-action-thousands-of-prisoners-still-denied-access-to-books/) state prisons.
-   Tenants who were evicted from [83-85 Bowery](https://maps.google.com/?q=83-85+Bowery&entry=gmail&source=g) in Chinatown have gone on a [hunger strike](https://www.amny.com/news/bowery-tenants-hunger-strike-1.16583531) in front of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to protest their displace by the landlord.
-   A taxi driver [committed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/nyregion/livery-driver-taxi-uber.html) suicide on the steps of City Hall in protest of Mayor Bloomberg, Mayor de Blasio, and Governor Cuomo's failure to protect longtime taxi drivers from the destabilizing forces of Uber and Lyft. It was apparently the [third](https://www.democracynow.org/2018/2/7/nyc_taxi_driver_kills_himself_at) driver suicide in as many months, as many drivers face inescapable financial turmoil.
-   [Inwood](https://citylimits.org/2018/02/06/city-review-of-inwood-rezoning-proposal-read-the-newsletter/) in Upper Manhattan is the fifth neighborhood to enter the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) under the DeBlasio administration's affordable housing plan. Residents of another neighborhood being considered for rezoning, Jerome Avenue in the Bronx, are [concerned](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/2/8/16985422/bronx-nyc-rezoning-jerome-avenue) that housing created under the plan will actually be affordable.
-   DSA members are [organizing](https://indypendent.org/2018/02/rats-in-the-hallway/) with an East Harlem tenants union against a negligent and abusive slumlord.

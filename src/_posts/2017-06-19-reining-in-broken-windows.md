## Local News
* City officials [have directed the NYPD](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/nyregion/new-york-city-police-officers-told-to-relax-stance-on-petty-offenses.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&utm_source=RT_NYC_News&utm_medium=twitter&_r=0) to issue civil tickets rather than criminal summonses for petty offenses such as public drinking, being in a park after dark, and public urination. The city estimates that the new policy will divert about 100,000 people each year from the criminal justice system. Nevertheless, the Mayor [remains publicly committed](http://gothamist.com/2016/09/16/de_blasio_bratton_broken_windows.php) to Broken Windows policing.
* In related news, a federal judge [approved a $75 million settlement](http://www.amny.com/news/nypd-to-pay-75m-for-issuing-illegal-broken-windows-summonses-to-meet-quotas-1.13731830?mc_cid=21796af493&mc_eid=1a9d72cbc4) to resolve a class action lawsuit against the NYPD for issuing Broken Windows summonses to meet quotas. The city [denied that the NYPD has used quotas, but agreed to send a notice](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/judge-finalizes-75m-deal-nypd-summons-quotas-lawsuit-article-1.3242402?mc_cid=21796af493&mc_eid=1a9d72cbc4) to police officers stating that quotas are banned and are subject to Internal Affairs investigations.
* The MTA's plan to update its outdated signal system--a major reason for the recent surge in subway delays--is years behind schedule and underfunded by billions of dollars, according to a [report released by the City's Independent Budget Office](http://gothamist.com/2017/06/14/subway_signals_mta_repairs.php) on Tuesday. The Governor's office criticized the report, and [Cuomo continues to prioritize drivers ahead of mass transit](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/06/13/cuomo-to-nycs-suffering-subway-commuters-drive-a-car/) by announcing expedited road construction ahead of this summer's Penn Station shutdown.

* Republican state senators are [hoping to extract concessions](https://www.wnyc.org/story/senate-gop-pushes-buffet-bills-extend-mayoral-control-schools/) on charter school caps in order to grant an extension of mayoral control of schools to de Blasio. With less than a week to go before the end of the legislative session, [Cuomo publicly supports](http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2017/06/cuomo-says-he-wants-mayoral-control-plus-charter-school-plan/) such a compromise.
* The State's Commission on Forensic Science voted to [allow police to broaden DNA searches to include close but inexact matches](http://gothamist.com/2017/06/16/familial_dna_testing_ny_state.php) in some cases, a policy that has been called "genetic stop-and-frisk."

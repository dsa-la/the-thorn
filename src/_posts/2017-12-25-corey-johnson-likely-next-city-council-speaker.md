title: Corey Johnson Likely Next City Council Speaker + Compromised Right to Know Act Bill Passes
---

## Local News
-   Corey Johnson has apparently [secured enough votes](https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/corey-johnson-has-votes-become-council-speaker-reports-say) to become the next City Council Speaker by brokering a deal with the Bronx and Queens Democratic Party leaders. The official vote from City Council will happen in January. The decision was apparently [timed](http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2017/12/mayor-gets-rolled-in-speaker-race/) by the Queens and Bronx Democratic machines to occur unbeknownst to the Mayor while he was in Iowa. Council Members Robert Cornegy and Jumaane Williams have refused to concede to Johnson, [protesting](http://cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-and-elections/new-york-city-council-speaker-candidates-concede-to-corey-johnson.html#.Wj6SmPZOnCI) the lack of people of color in power at City Hall.
-   Crain's highlights that Johnson has received [over $63,000](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20171221/POLITICS/171229979/real-estate-execs-made-63000-investment-in-new-city-council-speaker) in campaign contributions from real estate interests, including $10k from the developer of the Hudson Yards, which is in his district.
-   The federal tax bill recently signed into law portends doom for both the [State](http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7370-state-faces-budget-deficit-ahead-of-possible-gut-punch-from-washington) and [City](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/12/19/not-just-salt-gop-tax-plan-holds-other-dangers-for-citys-budget-153736) budget.
-   The City Council [passed](http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2017/12/20/bills-pass-right-to-know-act-nyc-council-nypd-oversight) both parts of the Right to Know Act, with Council Member Ritchie Torres' altered Intro 182-D securing a 27-20 margin, the narrowest Council vote of the entire de Blasio administration. Torres' acquiescence to the Mayor and the NYPD and his justification in saying that the NYPD would not accept the original bill raises [questions](https://citylimits.org/2017/12/20/the-bigger-questions-raised-by-the-councils-right-to-know-vote/) about separation of powers in the City government.
-   Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña is [stepping](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/12/21/how-carmen-farina-sought-to-change-americas-largest-school-system-one-school-at-a-time-160954) down after four years of reversing many of the Bloomberg administration's education policies but leaving issues surrounding school integration and underperforming schools unaddressed.
-   Uber is publicly [supporting](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uber-endorse-congestion-pricing-subway-funds-tv-ad-article-1.3712015?cid=bitly) congestion pricing, as they believe that a tolling structure will draw New Yorkers out of their personal cars and into for-hire vehicles.
-   A waste equity bill supported by the Mayor and the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance was mysteriously [killed](http://cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/waste-equity-bill-killed-new-york-city-legislation.html#.Wj6V0vZOnCI) in the City Council's final 2017 session last week.
-   Infamous landlord Steve Croman will have to pay $8 million to tenants he harassed and will be subject to increased monitoring, as a result of a [settlement](https://therealdeal.com/2017/12/20/steve-croman-agrees-to-pay-record-8m-to-tenants-he-harassed/) reached yesterday with the State Attorney General's office. It is the largest ever settlement with an individual landlord in New York.
-   A new [coalition](https://citylimits.org/2017/12/15/upstate-downstate-call-on-cuomo-for-housing-reforms/) called the Upstate Downstate Housing Alliance hopes to build statewide support to win housing reforms for renters and public housing tenants.

## Elections
-   NYC-based IDC Senators Marisol Alcantara (District 31, Upper Manhattan), Jesse Hamilton (District 20, Central Brooklyn), Jose Peralta (District 13, Northern Queens), and conference leader Jeff Klein (District 34, Bronx/Westchester) appear to be each facing organized and significant [challenges](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/12/21/candidates-lining-up-to-challenge-idc-turncoats-in-2018/) in next September's primaries.
-   Assembly Member Luis Sepúlveda (District 87, Parkchester) [announced](http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2017/12/sepulveda-announces-senate-bid/) his plans to run for the State Senate's 32nd district seat once Council Member-elect Ruben Diaz, Sr. vacates it in January and Cuomo sets a date for a special election. As the Bronx Democratic machine's preferred pick, Sepúlveda has a likely path to victory, but there are [fears](https://www.wnyc.org/story/candidates-angle-replace-state-senators-possible-special-election/) that he may join the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) once elected.
-   Cuomo released a "Democracy Agenda" [platform](http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7384-cuomo-unveils-democracy-agenda-of-ad-transparency-election-security-and-voting-reforms) for New York State that includes long-sought progressive electoral reforms like early voting and automatic voter registration. Its prospects are [questionable](https://twitter.com/NomikiKonst/status/943935835833012225) in a Republican/IDC controlled Senate.
-   City Hall is [investigating](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/city-hall-cop-impersonating-state-sen-marty-golden-article-1.3714734) State Senator Marty Golden's (District 22, Southern Brooklyn) parking placard use. Meanwhile, Democratic challenger Ross Barkan is gathering media and fundraising [attention](https://indypendent.org/2017/12/the-muckraker-vs-the-muck/) in his push to defeat the Republican.

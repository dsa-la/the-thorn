## In-Depth: Congestion Pricing.

***History***

Congestion pricing refers to a mechanism that tolls vehicles entering a busy area of a city in order to discourage driving, cut traffic, and fund transit. Such programs currently exist in cities like London, Stockholm, and Singapore. Congestion pricing is a particularly salient issue in New York City due to its irrational tolling distribution; the four East River bridges (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro) that lead drivers directly into Manhattan's central business districts are free, while other Â major bridges and tunnels are steeply tolled, meaning drivers are essentially incentivized to drive straight into the busiest parts of the City.

While some form of congestion pricing in New York City was proposed as early as the 1970s, the most recent attempt to pass such a measure was in 2008, when Mayor Bloomberg tried and failed to win support for the initiative in the State Legislature. Bloomberg's plan was designed to toll all cars coming into Manhattan south of 60th street (via other boroughs and northern Manhattan) with a flat fee from 6AM-6PM. The billions in new revenue were intended to fund a host of new subway, bus, and rail improvements and expansions throughout the City. The plan passed a City Council vote 30-20, but was fiercely opposed by many outer-borough politicians, including then-Council Member Bill de Blasio, who called the plan regressive and "[unfair to the outer-boroughs.](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170903/POLITICS/170909992)" The plan was also opposed by the [parking-garage company lobby](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/council-panel-approves-congestion-pricing-measure/). Although the plan had support from then-Governor Patterson, the Republican-controlled State Senate, and other power brokers on both sides of the aisle, it died in the Assembly due to [then-Speaker Sheldon Silver refusing to hold a vote](http://observer.com/2008/04/sheldon-silver-and-the-assembly-kill-congestion-pricing/) and preventing the positions of vulnerable Assembly Members from being put on the record.

***MoveNY***

Congestion Pricing has gained new traction in the past few years as MTA service has declined spectacularly and traffic congestion has worsened in large part due to [an unregulated explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/nyregion/uber-ride-hailing-new-york-transportation.html) of Uber and Lyft. [MoveNY](http://iheartmoveny.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Move-NY-Fair-Plan-150217v1.pdf), a plan devised by a former NYC transportation commissioner, [was publicly proposed by activists in 2015](http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2015/02/17/the-complete-guide-to-the-final-move-ny-plan/) as a compromise measure that was seen to have addressed some of the criticisms of the original Bloomberg plan. It still tolled all vehicles entering Manhattan below 60th Street, but it provided toll relief targeted at outer-borough drivers, including lowering tolls on certain bridges, and preventing situations where vehicles could be tolled twice in an hour. This new plan has gained support from a number of [outer-borough entities](http://www.silive.com/news/2015/05/staten_island_officials_are_op_1.html) that previously opposed Bloomberg's 2008 push, as well as a host of unions, the Working Families Party, and other [progressive organizations](http://iheartmoveny.org/#supporters). With Sheldon Silver out of power and the City Council controlled by more transit-friendly progressives than it was 9 years ago, the new plan appears to have at least a marginally clearer path through City and State government.

***Current Prospects***

After years of dismissing the concept, Governor Cuomo surprised many this summer by [suggesting that he would consider congestion pricing](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/8/14/16142868/cuomo-congestion-pricing-plan-nyc) and subsequently appointing a [panel](https://nypost.com/2017/10/05/cuomo-appoints-panel-to-study-congestion-pricing/) to study it. Mayor de Blasio, in line with his 2008 City Council vote and his endless feud with the Governor, has signaled a firm opposition to any congestion pricing plan. De Blasio is instead trying to rally support behind a ["Millionaire's Tax" to fund transit](http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/08/21/de-blasio-espouses-one-mta-funding-long-shot-eschews-another-114042), which appears in part to be a move to "out-progressive" the Governor due to its blatantly poor odds of succeeding. The State Legislature would have to pass such a tax, and de Blasio has already tried proposing similar levies to fund two other initiatives over his first term (universal pre-K and subsidized senior housing) and failed both times.

There is some debate about whether a congestion pricing mechanism would be progressive or regressive, although much of the debate has been skewed by the disproportionate political influence of NYC car owners, [whose median income levels are far higher than their car-less neighbors](http://blog.tstc.org/2017/04/21/car-free-new-york-city/). Furthermore, the MoveNY report projects that their plan would result in an increase in tolls for only 3% of trips taken within the five boroughs, and that those trips are primarily taken by relatively high-income households anyway. However, there is also warranted skepticism over whether Governor Cuomo could be trusted to ensure that a program would be implemented in the public's best interest. Cuomo has been [vague](http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/08/21/so-far-cuomos-congestion-pricing-plan-is-all-sizzle-no-steak/) about what his proposed congestion pricing system would entail, and he hasn't specifically mentioned MoveNY, so he could have other, less holistic solutions in mind. This is likely to be a major item of debate in the coming 2018 State legislative season and could be a flashpoint in next year's state elections, especially as many State legislative seats are likely to be contested next fall thanks to a post-Trump groundswell of political activism.

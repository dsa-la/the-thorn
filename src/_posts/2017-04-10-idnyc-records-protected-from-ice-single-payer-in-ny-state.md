## In-Depth: HEALTH CARE BABY

As New Yorkers consider the progress made under the Affordable Care Act as well as its limitations, support and interest in universal and single-payer healthcare has grown. The New York Health Act (NYHA), which would create a statewide, single-payer system, is in State Assembly committee again, after having passed the Assembly in 2015 and 2016 but failing in the Senate. In the last few days of March, the bill picked up critical support, as every member of the [Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) ](https://twitter.com/nycDSAelectoral/status/851325988248190976)announced they would [co-sponsor the bill](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-idc-single-payer-health-care_us_58dd34c6e4b0e6ac709300e1), though their debates at the vote to pass the state  [budget on April 9t](http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/04/after-a-night-of-senate-sniping-state-budget-is-fully-enacted-111137)h seem to suggest that their support is not sincere.

**How the NYHA works:** If passed, the Act will expand health coverage to everyone in New York State, while also lowering the amount of money that the state spends on healthcare each year by removing health insurance companies from the equation. Coverage under NYHA would include primary and preventive care, hospital care, prescription drugs, and dental, vision, and hearing care. Patients would see increased choice in healthcare providers by removing network restrictions that limit their ability to see the doctor of their choosing, and [95% of people would spend less money overall on care](http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what-is-single-payer).

Savings would come from the elimination of copays and deductibles; funds would come from assessments on payroll and non-payroll income, with contributions generated by income and ability to pay. Employers would pay 80% of payroll assessment costs for healthcare, and employees would pay the remaining 20% (those who are self-employed would pay the full payroll assessment). These savings are possible because a single-payer system would reduce the amount of money and time employers spend administering health plan costs, eliminate health insurance companies' profits, and lower the prices of drug and medical devices, among other things.

**Political outlook:** Healthcare advocates are hoping that this bill will be more successful than in years past.  It is expected to pass the Assembly again this year and gain at least one more Senate vote after a special election in May.  However, without support from at least one Senate Republican or Simcha Felder, the sole Democrat who has not co-sponsored the bill, the NYHA will not pass the Senate and will be pushed back to the next legislative session. Rallies in New York City and Albany were held [last week](http://wamc.org/post/activists-rally-demand-albany-pass-ny-single-payer-bill) to demonstrate to lawmakers that many of their constituents support a single-payer healthcare system and to put pressure on those who do not yet co-sponsor the bill to do so.

The NYC DSA Socialist Feminist Working Group democratically voted to focus on single-payer health care as their initial campaign and yesterday April 9th canvassed for it in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge. In California, DSA East Bay has chosen to focus on a similar statewide single-payer health care act, [SB 562](http://www.healthycaliforniaact.org), as their [branch-wide campaign](https://eastbaydsa.org/healthcare/).

**Why the NYHA matters:** Healthcare access and affordability has significant economic, labor, and social justice implications. Medical bills are the number one cause of bankruptcies in the US, and at least a third of Americans have not sought treatment for medical care at some point out of fear of the cost. Healthcare is also a labor issue because by breaking the tie between insurance and employment, workers could make more demands without fear for their health or the health of their families. It's also a feminist issue: women [use more](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/health/policy/women-still-pay-more-for-health-insurance-data-shows.html) healthcare services over the course of their life, giving birth is [particularly expensive](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-31052665), and women are [more likely than men](http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/womens-health-insurance-coverage-fact-sheet/) to be dependent on their spouse's coverage.

California, Massachusetts, and Vermont have made efforts to implement a statewide single-payer health system, but none of their attempts have come to fruition so far. New York could be instrumental in demonstrating that it is possible for single-payer healthcare to be enacted in the U.S. Successfully implementing a plan that provides non-discriminatory coverage to everyone in one of the most populous states could move the U.S. one step closer to becoming a country where people no longer have to decide between medical care or bankruptcy.

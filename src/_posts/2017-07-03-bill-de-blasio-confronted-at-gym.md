## Local News
* Bill de Blasio, who wears cargo shorts and a belt at the gym, was [confronted by activists from the #closeRIKERS campaign](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170630/park-slope/de-blasio-close-rikers-protesters-gym) while exercising. Darren Mack tried to offer the Mayor guidelines for closing the jail at Rikers more quickly than the current 10-year timeline, before being removed.
* Governor Cuomo declared a 30-day “State of Emergency” for the MTA on Thursday, triggering a [temporary hold on some bureaucratic processes](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/what-does-cuomos-mta-state-of-emergency-really-mean.html) that typically delay procurement and repairs. He also requested organizational and capital plan reviews to be completed in 60 days.
* Bushwick will get [fewer affordable units than originally promised](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170626/bushwick/hpd-housing-affordable-housing-law-department-bushwick-rheingold) at the former Rheingold Brewery site, highlighting the non-binding nature of Community Benefits Agreements, particularly once a site has been sold. One of the site's current owners, the Rabsky Group, is the developer for a proposed [1,000+ unit development in the Broadway Triangle](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170615/williamsburg/pfizer-affordable-housing-jewish-hispanic-ethnic-tension) that is making its way through the [ULURP](https://citylimits.org/zonein/ulurp-explained/) process.
* The State Legislature came to a deal that [extends mayoral control](https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/06/29/state-reaches-deal-on-mayoral-control-giving-mayor-bill-de-blasio-a-two-year-extension/) of NYC public schools for another two years. Although Senate Republicans sought to link charter school expansion to a mayoral control deal, no such provisions were included in the deal.
* The Young Women’s Initiative, a group convened by City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, had explicitly encouraged her to help pass two police reform bills (including the Right to Know Act) which she [still refuses to bring to a vote](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/nyc-lawyers-urge-mark-viverito-vote-reform-bills-article-1.2943072). The publicly released version of the group’s report [was edited to include only broad policy suggestions](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/city-council-speaker-ignores-police-reform-panel-article-1.3277649) regarding criminal justice reform.
* To settle a lawsuit stemming from its abuse of protesters, the NYPD [agreed to comply with the Freedom of Information Law requests](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/06/29/to-settle-lawsuit-nypd-promises-to-finally-follow-freedom-of-information-law/) it has been violating since 2006.
* Council Member Robert Cornegy (Bedford-Stuyvesant) wants to name a local basketball court after the Notorious B.I.G. but is facing [pushback from some residents who find his lyrics offensive](http://nypost.com/2017/07/01/beef-in-bed-stuy-over-push-to-name-park-after-biggie-smalls/).
* The full Community Board 9 in Crown Heights echoed the vote of its Land Use Committee by [unanimously rejecting the Bedford Union Armory development proposal](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170628/crown-heights/bedford-union-armory-redevelopment-rejected-ulurp-cb9-vote). The next step in ULURP is for the Brooklyn borough president’s office to review the proposal.
* The Rent Guidelines Board [voted to approve](https://citylimits.org/2017/06/27/seven-proposals-before-rent-guidelines-board-as-final-vote-nears/) a 1.25% increase on one-year leases and a 2% increase on two-year leases in rent stabilized units, the first such increase in two years. The decision [drew fervent protests from tenants and the Rent Justice Coalition](http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/40/26/dtg-rent-justice-coalition-march-rally-2017-06-30-bk.html).

## Elections
* Republican real estate executive Paul Massey [dropped out of the 2017 mayoral race](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170628/POLITICS/170629873&template=rwd&) even though he was a [frontrunner](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/nyregion/new-york-city-mayoral-candidate-paul-massey.html) in fundraising. The announcement largely clears Assemblymember Nicole Malliotakis' (Staten Island) path to the Republican nomination.
* Rev. Khader El-Yateem, a DSA-endorsed candidate in City Council District 43, penned [an Op-Ed on how the MTA’s problems have harmed his district](http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/mta-capital-projects-harmful-small-business-commuters/).  
* The NYC Board of Elections [released a report revealing how the City's strict primary voting laws suppress turnout](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7036-8-new-report-shows-shockingly-low-voter-turnout-in-nyc), which was as low as 8% in last September's primary.
* Nine of the candidates for NYC Mayor who aren't Bill De Blasio [attended a Mayoral forum in East Flatbush](http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/mayoral-forum-b-list-candidates-score-points) this week with affordable housing being one of the main topics of discussion.
* Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez [echoed his support of Ken Thompson’s decision](https://twitter.com/5BoroDefenders/status/880925393099907073) to recommend no jail time for Akai Gurley’s killer, Peter Liang. One of his opponents in the DA race, [Marc Fliedner, resigned in protest of that decision](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marc-fliedner-makes-history-as-the-first-openly-gay_us_5943f23de4b024b7e0df4b3c).

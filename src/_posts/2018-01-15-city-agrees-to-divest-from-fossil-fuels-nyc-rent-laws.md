## In-Depth: NYC RENT LAWS

New York City has some of the most expansive rent regulation in the country, which enables low-income households and people of color to continue living in an ever gentrifying city. However, tenants are constantly battling with landlords and developers as the real estate industry seeks to diminish their rights. This battle will come to a head on June 15, 2019 when the New York State Rent Laws are set to expire, leaving millions of New Yorkers at risk of losing the rent regulation protections provided under the current laws.

The rent laws determine several aspects of rent regulation, particularly how a landlord can deregulate an apartment. Deregulation occurs when the monthly rent is increased to a rent threshold, which is currently set at $2,733.75. Once the apartment meets this threshold, it is deregulated and becomes a market rate apartment, which means the landlord can charge whatever they want without concern for affordability.

Currently, the law has several loopholes that make it easy for landlords to meet this threshold. For instance, a landlord can increase the rent by 20 percent each time a tenant moves out, making it much easier to meet the deregulation threshold. Advocates and some progressive lawmakers have [tried](https://citylimits.org/2015/05/04/why-i-want-to-end-vacancy-decontrol-and-save-rent-regulated-housing/) to end this process, otherwise known as vacancy decontrol, but have so far been unsuccessful in the face of pervasive real estate lobbying. Such laws encourage landlords to harass tenants and allow apartments to fall into disrepair in hopes the tenants will move out. This has far reaching [implications](http://www.maketheroad.org/report.php?ID=880): mold, as well as rat and roach infestations lead to higher instances of asthma and other health conditions, particularly among communities of color. As a result of deregulation, thousands of rent-regulated apartments [have been lost](https://ny.curbed.com/2015/7/15/9940218/mapping-the-rent-stabilized-apartments-nycs-lost-since-2007) over the years.

There is no doubt that the real estate industry will be fighting hard to eliminate tenant protections and increase their own profits. However, the upcoming expiration of the rent laws is also a great opportunity to expand tenants' rights and close loopholes. In 2015 (the last time the rent laws expired), the State passed new ones which increased the deregulation threshold each year at the same rate set by the Rent Guidelines Board for one-year lease increases. This was an improvement, as the deregulation threshold had previously remained the same each year, while rents increased. This fall's State Legislative elections and the resulting balance of power in the State Senate (which in 2015 was controlled by Republicans and the IDC) will have a major effect on next year's rent law negotiations.

The Housing Working Groups of NYC-DSA are committed to removing the profit motive from housing and moving toward a world without private property. Our homes are a basic human need to keep us warm in the winter, to shelter us from the rain, to provide a place for families and communities to come together. Our homes should not be a means for a small group of people to reap profits by providing housing only to those willing to pay the highest price, and denying it to those who can't afford it. The NYC-DSA Housing Working Groups are currently gearing up to fight the battle over the rent laws by launching a tenant organizing campaign to build power among tenants. We demand universal rent control in 2019! And through tenant organizing, rent regulated tenants can come together to confront their landlords and demand rent laws that put people before profits.

We have an upcoming tenant organizing training on February 10th. To get involved, email Cea Weaver at <cea.weaver@gmail.com>

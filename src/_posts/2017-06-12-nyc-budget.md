## Local News
* The 2018 New York City budget [was passed this week](http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/387-17/mayor-de-blasio-speaker-mark-viverito-city-council-reach-early-agreement-fy2018-budget-?mc_cid=77518e63d5&mc_eid=1a9d72cbc4#/0). Proceedings were not without drama, particularly [in the form of a disagreement between](http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/06/06/after-years-of-harmony-drama-over-a-budget-vote-hits-city-hall-112571) Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito over city funding for legal defense fees for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Mayor de Blasio wanted to withhold from individuals who had committed "serious" (felony-level) crimes. Speaker Mark-Viverito [inserted additional funds into the budget in a separate item](http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/06/02/de-blasio-mark-viverito-announce-budget-deal-agreeing-to-disagree-on-immigrant-defense-fund-112508) to preserve the availability of legal aid. The Mayor has the ability to veto the additional program, though it is unclear at this point whether he will do so.
* A number of City politicians, including Mayoral candidate Nicole Malliotakis and rogue Democrat State Senator Simcha Felder, [were vocal in their belief that de Blasio should veto](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gop-mayoral-hopeful-calls-de-blasio-shut-city-budget-article-1.3228490) the additional budget provisions added by the City Council.
* The De Blasio administration [chose not to include a proposed Fair Fares](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170608/civic-center/subway-l-train-turnstile-jumping-nypd-arrest-fair-fares) pilot program in the City budget passed this week.
* Mayor De Blasio is [refusing to back the "Move NY" congestion pricing plan](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-won-back-congestion-pricing-plan-reduce-gridlock-article-1.3224051) that would produce 1.3 billion dollars worth of tolls per year.
* The NYC pension fund will be the [first in nation to fully divest from private prisons](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-pension-fund-back-private-prisons-article-1.3229217) after a unanimous vote by its trustees.
* Despite recent pressure from the national DNC and congressional Democrats, the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) is [still refusing to budge](http://buffalonews.com/2017/06/05/senator-klein-pushes-critics-calls-stewart-cousins-give-leadership-post/) from its power sharing agreement with Senate Republicans, preventing mainline New York Democrats from gaining a majority in the State Senate.
* The referendum on a statewide constitutional convention [on the ballot this November](http://gothamist.com/2017/06/06/ny_constitutional_convention.php) is pitting progressive activists who support the convention against organized labor, which opposes it.
* One of NYC's largest landlords, Steve Croman, will likely spend [a year on Rikers Island](https://therealdeal.com/2017/06/06/steve-croman-pleads-guilty-will-serve-1-year-in-state-prison/?utm_source=The+Real+Deal+E-Lerts&utm_campaign=6532fabb6d-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_06_06&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e806bb87a-6532fabb6d-389355777) after pleading guilty to grand larceny and tax fraud. He would be one of the only NYC landlords to serve jail time for illegal business practices, and he has an additional case pending against him for tenant harassment. |


## Elections
* [Christine Parker](http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/kevin-parkers-cousin-christina-parker-turns-republican-enters-city-council-race/), the deputy director of the Cultural Museum of African Art and cousin of State Senator Kevin Parker, [has entered the 35th Council District race as a Republican](https://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2017/5/30/brooklyn-gop-endorses-christine-parker-city-council), challenging DSA endorsee Jabari Brisport (Green) and the eventual winner of the Democratic primary between Laurie Cumbo and Ede Fox.
* Queens Council Member Julissa Ferreras' surprise announcement that she won't not seek re-election [has thrown a wrench into the speaker's race](http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/06/07/city-council-speakers-race-shifts-leaving-white-men-dominant-112622) next year, with liberal establishment support potentially headed to Mark Levine (West Harlem), Corey Johnson (Chelsea), or others.
* Ede Fox, a challenger to incumbent Laurie Cumbo in the 35th Council District (Crown Heights), released a statement [calling for an expedited Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) on the Bedford-Union Armory](http://citylimits.org/2017/06/07/council-challenger-demands-speedy-vote-on-bedford-union-armory/). If successful, this would force Cumbo to make a final vote before September's Democratic primary.
* On the federal level, Governor Cuomo is [launching a campaign with Nancy Pelosi](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/gov-cuomo-launching-bid-unseat-n-y-house-republicans-article-1.3224577) to help Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives in 2018.

## Small Donors of Dark Money
*Special interests flood District 35 and 43 primaries*

Political candidates, especially ones running for municipal seats like city council, often tout their local credentials through the presence of small donors. While all candidates would prefer you envision "small donors" as ordinary middle class crusaders seeking to better their communities, in reality "small donors" can just as easily mean small donations (sometimes made over and over) by some of biggest, most imposing powers that exist, especially in a city where Wall Street traders, Midtown developers, and international retail giants are part of the "local" milieu.

A common feature of political fundraising rolls, both in NYC and nationally, is the presence of donors with listed occupations like "consultant," "government relations advisor," and "public affairs liaison"---otherwise known as lobbyists---who specialize in influence peddling for the highest bidders, with the bids getting higher by the day. [According to Ross Barkan of the *Village Voice*](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/05/04/its-a-good-time-to-be-a-lobbyist-in-nyc/), City Hall lobbyists raked in a record $95.4 million dollars in 2016, up from $62 million in 2013. Consultants help to guide city administrators and legislators to policy conclusions that often include deregulation, non-prosecution, and tax relief, among other favors needed for their clients.

While campaign donations are just one of a lobbyist's many tools for shaping these policy outcomes, their presence in campaign funding is often insidious enough for them to frequently attempt to conceal and obscure it, through techniques like making multiple small donations rather than large sums, and using side businesses, friends, and family members to donate to candidates they're comfortable with. In what is said to be a common practice, prominent Staten Island real estate and [labor lobbyist Vito Pitta has been known to "bundle"](http://nypost.com/2015/05/24/lobbying-firm-makes-millions-on-political-union-ties/)medium-size donations matched many times over by city taxpayers through himself, his lobbying firm, and his wife, among other outlets. Three of his firm's employees have made matching donations to the campaign of [Democrat Justin Brannan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Lee_Brannan).

Brannan, a former Bear Stearns staffer and venture capital fundraiser running as a progressive in the District 43 Democratic primary (which is being contested by DSA endorsee Khader El-Yateem), has received the bulk of his large donations from himself and his family---Brannan's mother, wife, and mother-in-law have each made the maximum contribution of $2,750.

But deeper in Brannan's list is evidence of tacit approval of his campaign from a wide array of high-rolling City Hall puppeteers. Capalino & Company, headed by key allies of Mayor Bill De Blasio and boasting clients like Uber and a large number of commercial real estate firms, has made donations to Brannan through multiple employees. The firm Constantinople & Vallone, which advises city officials on behalf of such patrons as T-Mobile, the Patrolmens Benevolent Association, and even the Trump Organization, has given Brannan a $250 thumbs up. Also making a $500 donation to Brannan's campaign was the New York City Hospital Alliance, a consortium arranged for labor bargaining on behalf of employers against city hospital staff.

Laurie Cumbo's incumbent campaign in District 35, against challengers including DSA's Jabari Brisport, features the support of similar entities. Evan Stavisky of the Parkside Group, [considered the business arm of the powerful Queens Democratic patronage machine](http://citylimits.org/2013/05/13/when-campaign-aides-are-lobbyists-questions-mount/), has donated $250 to Cumbo's campaign. Jeffrey Rodus, a former chief of staff of to current council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, has made a $250 donation to Cumbo and currently works on behalf of Verizon, Capital One, and Clear Channel in his job with city public affairs firm Connelly, McLaughlin, & Woloz. Cumbo has received additional contributions from established lobbying firms like Yoswein New York and the busy public affairs office of Consolidated Edison.

Perhaps even more concerning in Cumbo's filings is the massive amount of donations coming in from major real estate interests, which don't even bother with the masking process of lobbying firms. While unsurprising given her pivotal role in the Bedford Union Armory decision-making process, Cumbo has pulled large donations from figures like William Wallace of luxury developer Continuum Company. Wallace has given $2,000 to Cumbo, partially hiding the amount by giving it in  installments. Cumbo has also received donations from multiple employees of the Corcoran Group, a real estate firm that frequently handles sales for BFC Partners, the proposed developer of the Armory project. Additional developers donating to the campaign include executives from the Hudson Companies, Vornado, and TerraCRG. Cumbo has a number of other curious, well-moneyed non--real-estate backers including the Pfizer PAC, which represents the pharmaceutical giant, and former high-level executives at Washington Mutual and Philip Morris International.

Even Ede Fox, an insurgent Democratic challenger to Cumbo, has the eye of the City Hall consultant shadow government, though not to the same extent as Brannan and Cumbo, perhaps due to Fox's smaller chances of winning. Employees from Capalino & Company have given to Fox as well as employees from  the aforementioned Vito Pitta's Pitta, Bishop, and Del Giorno firm.

Neither BKDSA endorsee lists a single contribution from an employee of the aforementioned lobbying firms or real estate developers. The majority of Khader El-Yateem's fundraising (currently at $93,629.66 compared to Brannan's $99,536.17) comes from members of the local and even the national Middle Eastern community, who are undoubtedly excited by his chance to be the first Arab-American to win elected office in the nation's largest city. While Jabari Brisport is yet to break through early, with a current total of $4,769.17 raised thus far, his social media presence has appeared to attract small donations from a vast assortment of ordinary individuals (including many students) throughout New York and the United States.

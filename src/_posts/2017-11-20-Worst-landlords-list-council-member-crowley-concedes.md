In his testimony, NYC Economic Development Corporation President James Patchett [committed](https://www.amny.com/real-estate/bedford-union-armory-1.14980320) to reevaluate the proposal. If the subcommittee approves the deal, it will still have to clear a full City Council vote in order to move forward.

## Elections

## In-Depth: Algorithmic Transparency---What City Agencies Do With Our Data

**From the NYC-DSA Tech Action Working Group**

On Monday, October 16th, the New York City Council Committee on Technology held an [introductory hearing](http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=564867&GUID=9567478C-C9F4-4EDE-89F2-947E95A94ACD&Options=&Search=) on a bill that would require "Algorithmic Transparency" for all data analysis software used by City agencies. [The bill](http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3137815&GUID=437A6A6D-62E1-47E2-9C42-461253F9C6D0) was put forward by Council Member James Vacca (District 13, The Bronx), Chair of the Council Committee on Technology. The targeted "algorithms" are any City-operated automated or computer-aided processing methods that "target services, impose penalties, or police persons." Software covered by this legislation is used to rank teachers and place students in schools, to fund and supply public housing, and to allocate police and firefighters throughout the city.

Currently, the City government has no centralized oversight of software being used by its various agencies. Because of contracts with third-party developers and purported security concerns, City agencies are often prohibited from releasing, or simply refuse to release information on the processes used to make core decisions. This legislation aims to fix that problem by centralizing oversight of this software, requiring source code be made public, and mandating agencies to allow for the public to test these systems with their own info. Such transparency is important for good governance because it allows the public to test for bias that is often introduced through human error or algorithmic hiccups. If adopted, this legislation would potentially be the first of its sort in the U.S., although [similar measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08813) have been introduced in the European Union.

Chairman Vacca began the hearing by saying opaque algorithms hinder our ability to hold government accountable and evaluate decision making---key parts of a functioning democracy. Vacca said that algorithms are bundles of coded assumptions, and if we can't evaluate the biases these assumptions exhibit, we can't hope to deal with inequities in our city. The committee heard testimony from the Mayor's office, from Donald Sunderland of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, and Craig Campbell of the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics. They spoke in opposition to the legislation, claiming that security and operational functionality would be compromised, and adding that an enormous amount of resources would be needed to rewrite current software to comply with the law's open source requirement. Vacca challenged the administration, rhetorically asking if parents have the right to know the reasoning behind their child's school placement when they were assigned their fifth or sixth choice, or if tenants are entitled to information on an inadequate public housing assignment. Short on answers to the specific inner workings of agencies, the representatives conceded it was an imperfect system, but reiterated that they could not support the legislation in its current form. Â 

Next, the floor was opened to testimony from the public. Opposition to the bill came from Tech NYC, a lobbying group representing the interests of NYC technology companies. They expressed concerns about intellectual property, actionable rights for individuals, security, the administrative burden on public agencies, and a lack of clear understanding regarding the bill's potential impact. However, the vast majority of public testimony was supportive. Research fellows at Cornell Tech spoke with some skepticism of the bill as currently worded. Members of NYC-DSA, Beta NYC, NYCLU, The Brennan Center for Justice, Bronx and Brooklyn Defenders, and The Legal Aid Society all spoke in favor. Many of the witnesses spoke to its necessity in criminal justice reform. Risk assessment algorithms that increase pretrial detention times, feedback loops that can send police officers back to neighborhoods that are already over policed, repeated errors in algorithmic sentencing that were shrouded in secrecy, and data that is tainted by years of disproportionate detention in communities of color were among the countless examples presented of gross failings of algorithms currently used locally and nationwide.

Some witnesses also spoke about the issue of public-private partnerships in this realm. Sumana Harihareswara of Changeset pointed out that the City is slated to spend $45 million on predictive policing technology in the coming years. She testified that the public should own that technology. Ownership of technology, as well as more robust public sector activity in developing these algorithms, would allow the City to correct problems internally without having to rely on---and continue to pay---private firms. Putting data and algorithms in the sphere of the commons could unearth a plethora of inefficiencies and inequities that were formerly cloaked, which would give insight to new ways of bettering society. Many argued that the security concerns expressed regarding disclosure of algorithms are illusory, and that open source would, in fact, allow for more robust security. It is also worth noting that fuller transparency would require public access to the data being fed into these systems.

Towards the end of the committee meeting, Chairman Vacca spoke to the possibility of convening a commission tasked with drafting a more robust version of the bill. As it stands, there are serious issues regarding the bill's rollout, as the current text is short and potentially overly broad, while at the same time missing important specifics about implementation. Moreover, due to term limits, Council Member Vacca will be vacating his City Council seat at the end of this year, along with two other members of the five-person Tech Committee. However, five of the bill's seven co-sponsors on the greater Council will remain. If a commission is formed, the Council appears to be open to input from experts and concerned citizens.

Going forward, it's reasonable to expect more pushback and opposition to this bill from the Mayor's Office and industry lobbyists present at this hearing, with the likely addition of law enforcement agencies and their backers. The NYC-DSA Tech Action Working Group has been in contact with Councilmember Vacca's office and will be monitoring the progress of this bill. Should it be convened, we will attempt to influence the commission to ensure publicly funded technology is kept under public oversight and control.
